# Cloud DevOps Engineer Capstone Project 5

This project represents the successful completion of the last final Capstone project and the Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity.

## Application


The Application is based on a python3 script using <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> to render a simple webpage in the user's browser.
A requirements.txt is used to ensure that all needed dependencies come along with the Application.

## Kubernetes Cluster

I use AWS CloudFormation to deploy the Kubernetes Cluster.
The CloudFormation Deployment can be broken down into four Parts:
- **Config Networking**, to ensure new nodes can communicate with the Cluster
- **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** is used to create a Kubernetes Cluster
- **Node**, each NodeGroup has a set of rules to define how instances are operated and created for the EKS-Cluster
- **Management** is needed to configure and manage the Cluster and its deployments and services. I created two management hosts for extra redundancy if one of them fails.

## CircleCi - CI/CD Pipelines

I used CircleCi to create a CI/CD  to test and deploy changes manually before they get deployed automatically to the Cluster using Ansible.

## Access the Application

After the EKS-Cluster has been successfully configured using Ansible within the CI/CD Pipeline, I checked the deployment and service as follows:

```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME                          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
project-capstone-deployment   4/4     4            4           68m

$ kubectl get services
NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                                  PORT(S)        AGE
project-capstone-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.240.221   ac183f8cf167449f4b2d330aafeb1dfe-1668269733.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:32299/TCP   69m
kubernetes                 ClusterIP      10.100.0.1       <none>                                                                       443/TCP        80m
```
